# Bing Spatial Data Services
The Bingâ„¢ Spatial Data Services Application Programming Interface (API) provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface that can geocode, store and query spatial data. This simple REST interface accomplishes tasks by setting parameters in a URL and then submitting the URL as an HTTP request. The HTTP response returns the results of the request.  
  
 With the [!INCLUDE[bm_spatialapi_product_name](../articles/includes/bm-spatialapi-product-name-md.md)], you can:  
  
-   Geocode and reverse-geocode large numbers of locations with the [Geocode Dataflow API](../spatial-data-services/geocode-dataflow-api.md).  
  
-   Store and query entities with a location, such as set of retail stores or restaurants using our [Data Source Management API](../spatial-data-services/data-source-management-api.md) and [Query API](../spatial-data-services/query-api2.md).  
  
 **Bing Maps Account Center (alternative)**:  You can also manage data sources and geocode using the [Bing Maps Account Center](http://www.bingmapsportal.com). For more information, see [Creating and Managing Data Sources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh698204.aspx).

 Transaction accounting is provided when you use the [!INCLUDE[bm_spatialapi_product_name](../articles/includes/bm-spatialapi-product-name-md.md)]. For more information about billable and non-billable transactions for the [!INCLUDE[bm_spatialapi_product_name](../articles/includes/bm-spatialapi-product-name-md.md)], see [Usage Transactions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff859477.aspx). There are also some use limits for this API. For more information, see [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../spatial-data-services/geocode-and-data-source-limits.md)
