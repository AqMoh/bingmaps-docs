# Release History
The following is a release history for Bing Spatial Data Services starting with January, 2013.  
  
|Date and Affected APIs|Release notes|  
|----------------------------|-------------------|  
|September 2016<br /><br /> -   [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md)|The maximum number of points a geography object can have has increased from 2,000 to 100,000.|  
|March 2016<br /><br /> -   [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md)|KML and ESRI Shapefiles can now be uploaded as a data source. ESRI Shapefiles are also automatically reprojected to the WGS84 spherical mercator projection for correct placement on Bing Maps.|  
|May 2014<br /><br /> -   [Geocode Dataflow API](geocode-dataflow-api/index.md)<br />-   [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md)|The maximum number of geocode and data source jobs that you can run in 24 hours for a non-enterprise account is increased from 5 to 50. See [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../spatial-data-services/geocode-and-data-source-limits.md).|  
|November 13, 2013<br /><br /> -   [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md)<br />-   [Query API](query-api/index.md)<br />-   [Make a Data Source Public](data-source-management-api/make-public-data-source.md)[NEW]|-   You can use geographical areas such as polygon, line string or a single point (latitude and longitude) to represent entity locations in your data source data schema.<br />     Reference: [Data Schema and Sample Input](data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/load-data-source-data-schema-and-sample-input.md), [Geography Types](data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/geography-types.md)<br />-   You can use the [Geography Types](data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/geography-types.md) to query for data source entities within a custom area defined by geographical shapes by using the “intersects” spatial filter function. If you want to return the intersection of an entity’s geographical shape with another geographical shape you specify, use the “intersection” function with the $select query option.<br />     Reference: [Query by Area](query-api/query-by-area.md)<br />-   The search limit for the [Query API](query-api/index.md) increases from 400 km to 1000 km.<br />     References: [Query by Area](query-api/query-by-area.md), [Query by Property](query-api/query-by-property.md)<br />-   You can request a list of all public data sources.<br />     Reference: [Make a Data Source Public](data-source-management-api/make-public-data-source.md)|  
|March, 2013|**Query for entities around an address.** When you query a data source for entities near a location ([Query by Area](query-api/query-by-area.md)), you can now specify an address string for the center point of your search.<br /><br /> **Stage a data source before publishing.** To stage and query data source data before you publish it, set the **loadOperation** parameter to **completeStaging** or **incrementalStaging** when you [Create a Load Data Source Job](data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/create-a-load-data-source-job-and-input-entity-data.md). You can query the staged data source by setting the `isStaging` parameter to `1` or `true` in your query. When you are ready to publish the data source, use the $commit URL described in [Publish a Staged Data Source](data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/publish-staged-data-source.md). Staged data sources that are not published are deleted after 30 days.<br /><br /> **Rollback a data source to a previous version.** You can [Rollback a Data Source Dataflow](data-source-management-api/rollback-data-source-dataflow.md) to a previous version of the entity data and schema. Up to two (2) previous versions are kept. You can get a list of previous versions and query for the schema (metadata) for those versions using the [Get Data Source Information](data-source-management-api/get-data-source-information.md) URLs.<br /><br /> **Download previous or staged data source versions.** You can download previous versions and the staged version of a data source using the job ID associated with that version. To get job IDs, see [Get Data Source Information](data-source-management-api/get-data-source-information.md). For download details, see [Create a Download Job](data-source-management-api/download-data-source-dataflow/create-a-download-job.md).<br /><br /> **Delete a staged data source.** You can delete a staged data source by setting the `isStaging` parameter to `1` or `true` when you [Delete a Data Source](data-source-management-api/delete-data-source.md).|  
|January, 2013|**View a list of all dataflow and data source jobs submitted in the last 15 days.** You can now [request a list](../spatial-data-services/get-job-list.md) of all [Geocode Dataflow API](geocode-dataflow-api/index.md) and [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md) jobs that you submitted in the last 15 days. Pending jobs are listed first.<br /><br /> **Request __Distance values with bounding box queries.** . When you [query for entities within a bounding box](query-api/query-by-area.md), you can return the distance from the center of the bounding box by adding __Distance to the $select query option. You can also sort bounding box query results by this distance when you set the $orderby parameter to __Distance.<br /><br /> **Use "$select=*,\__Distance" to return all entity properties and the distance to the entity property when you [Query by Area](query-api/query-by-area.md).**|
