# Getting Started with the Bing Maps REST Services
The Bingâ„¢ Maps REST Services Application Programming Interface (API) is a Representational State Transfer (REST) API that you can use to do common tasks, such as finding an address, retrieving a map with a pushpin and a label, or getting driving directions.
