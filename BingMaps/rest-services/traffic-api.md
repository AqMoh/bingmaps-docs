# Traffic API
Use the Traffic API to get information about traffic incidents and issues, such as construction sites and traffic congestion. For traffic incident coverage by country, see [Bing Maps Traffic Coverage](../coverage/bing-maps-traffic-coverage.md). For an overview of how traffic incident information is returned by the Routes API and the Traffic API, see [Getting Traffic Incident Data](../rest-services/getting-traffic-incident-data.md).
