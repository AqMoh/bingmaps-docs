|||  
|-|-|  
|[Get Elevations](../rest-services/get-elevations.md)|Use these URL templates to get elevations for a set of locations, a polyline or area on the Earth.|  
|[Elevation Data](../rest-services/elevation-data.md)|Use this description to understand the data values returned in the response.|  
|[Point Compression Algorithm](../rest-services/point-compression-algorithm.md)|Use this algorithm to create a compressed encoded string that represents a large number of locations. You can then use this string in place of a long list of coordinates when you request elevations.|
