# Bing Maps REST Services

The Bingâ„¢ Maps REST Services Application Programming Interface (API) provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface to perform tasks such as creating a static map with pushpins, geocoding an address, retrieving imagery metadata, or creating a route.  
  
Transaction accounting is provided when you use the Bing Maps REST Services. For more information about billable and non-billable transactions for the Bing Maps REST Services, see [Viewing Bing Maps Transaction Reports](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff859477.aspx).  

For information about geocoding large sets of spatial data using a REST Interface, see the [Bing Spatial Data Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701734.aspx).  

If you plan to use the REST services from .NET the Bing Maps team has released an open source portable class library which makes it easy to access the Bing Maps REST services from any .NET application. You can find this library on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/BingMapsRESTToolkit/).
