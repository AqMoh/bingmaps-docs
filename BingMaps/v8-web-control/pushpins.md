# Pushpins

Pushpins, sometimes known as MapIcons or Markers, are the primary method in the Bing Maps V8 Map Control to add a graphical image and text at a location within the map.

 To get your pushpin to look pixel-perfect, you'll also want to review how to [anchor your pushpins](../v8-web-control/anchoring-pushpins.md) to make them align with the chosen location on a map.
