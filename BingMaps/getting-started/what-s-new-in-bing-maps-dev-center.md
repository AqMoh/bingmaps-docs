# What&#39;s New in Bing Maps Dev Center
The following list describes the latest new features on the [!INCLUDE[maps_devportal_name](../getting-started/includes/maps-devportal-name-md.md)].  
  
 **July, 2014**  
  
 The Bing Maps Account Center has a new home (http://www.bing.com/dev/maps) and has been renamed Bing Maps Dev Center. These help pages have been updated for the new Dev Center. The functionality of the dev center has not changed.  
  
 **May, 2014**  
  
 **The maximum number of jobs that you can run in a 24 hour period is increased from 5 to 50 for non-enterprise accounts.** See [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../spatial-data-services/geocode-and-data-source-limits.md).  
  
 **New free-use limits for Spatial Data Services.**  
  
 Use of the Spatial Data Services now has the following transaction limits:  
  
-   All Bing Spatial Data Services transactions become billable when you reach ten (10) million transactions within a year, even if you use a session key.  
  
-   Bing Spatial Data Services batch geocode transactions become billable when you reach one (1) million batch geocode transactions within a year.
