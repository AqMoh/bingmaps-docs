# Getting Data Source Information
Click the **View data source information** under **Data Sources** in the [!INCLUDE[maps_devportal_name](../getting-started/includes/maps-devportal-name-md.md)] to view the master key, query key and query URL for all data sources associated with your [!INCLUDE[ve_platform_dev_acct](../getting-started/includes/ve-platform-dev-acct-md.md)]. This includes data sources that were created by using the [Bing Maps Dev Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) or by using the Bing Maps Spatial Data Services [Data Source Management API](../spatial-data-services/data-source-management-api.md). Query URLs are only provided for data sources that have been published.  
  
 **Transaction Accounting**: Transactions are counted when you use the [!INCLUDE[maps_devportal_name](../getting-started/includes/maps-devportal-name-md.md)] to create and manage data sources. For more information about these transactions, see [Understanding Bing Maps Transactions](../getting-started/understanding-bing-maps-transactions.md).
